# A4: Adding Persistence

date: 2021-13-10

## GitHub Link: [Todo App Code](https://github.com/tophbuddy/cs5520_cholzheu_projects/tree/main/CS5520/TodoApp)


## Project Summary

In this milestone, I was supposed to refactor my app using the recommended app architecture and add database persistence to the app using the Room persistence libary.

## Project Status

I unfortunately was not able to implpement what was required for this milestone so I will continue to work on it and update this blog post once I've implemented the aforementioned components.
I've added the necessary classes ,started to implement a recycler view to replace my list view and I am trying to start using fragments so I can utilize their re-usability.
