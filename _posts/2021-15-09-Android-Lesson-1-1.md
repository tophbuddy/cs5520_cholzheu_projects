# Android Fundamentals 01.1 Lesson

date: 2021-15-09

# Lesson Summary

This was a simple introductory lesson that main dealt with setting up the programming enviroment
for Android studio. 

It also introduced me to the various settings for creating a new project in android studio and 
what some of them mean. One of the main options is choosing the minimum android API version that 
my project can work on and it denotes the percentage of android devices this app project can 
work on based on the API chosen. Then I was walked through the layout of android studio and 
a had brief tour of some of the main files I will frequently work in and check like the build.gradle
file, app (java files), res (layouts, strings, images, etc.), and manifest file. I was shown how
I can edit some of these files to modify available components and permissions. The XML layout file
under res contains the elements for editing the Views (objects that can display the various activites
you can add to a mobile app) and in turn are powered by the activities and MainActivity files
that allow the addition of methods and functions to give power to the app functions.

Finally I learned about the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager and how to create a virtual 
device (or emulator) to run and test my apps on. I also had a brief introduction into Log statements
and how to use them to debug and glean information about the various constantly runnning processes.
