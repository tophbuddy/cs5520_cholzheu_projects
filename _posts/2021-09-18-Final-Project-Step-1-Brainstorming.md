#### Trigger:

The user notices multiple recurring charges on their credit/debit card account.

#### Desired Outcome:

The user logs in to the account to cancel the subscription if they decide they dont need it and they stop seeing the recurring charge on their bank/credit card statement.

#### Base Knowledge:

I expect the user knows all the services they are subscribed to.

#### Required Knowledge:

The user needs to know their login information for the service if it's online based or all necessary information otherwise. They need to know about their bank/credit card information so they start or stop that recurring charge and confirm that it's cancelled.

#### Desired Outcome:

The user goes on to a website on their computer or mobile phone to ask others or check a guide to figure out if their product is real or not.

#### Desired Outcome:

The user finds a local charity with a specified cause they want to support and makes a donation. The user also confirms that the donation has been made and that they chose a legitimate charity.

#### Base Knowledge:
