# Final Project Proposal

date: 2021-10-11

## Final Project Choice

For the final project I have decided that I will add new features to my existing ToDo Application instead of creating a brand new app. I feel that I haven't gained
a great grasp of mobile application development yet and by adding new features on my own I believe that I can fix this deficiency in my knowledge.

There are three features that I've chosen to implement into my ToDo App. I will improve the visual design of the UI to improve user experience and the overall
aesthetics of the app. I will add the ability to add a map location to a to-do and lastly I will add the ability to alter the order of to-dos by dragging and dropping. 

## Feature Choice 1: UI Visual Design Upgrade

My approach to improving the UI of my app will start with looking at other existing mobile apps and finding a UI that I like so I have a starting point for
my own design. I will create mockups of what it could look like and that will assist me in deciding the changes to the xml files I will need to make in order
for my app to reflect my proposed redesign.

An example of an app that utilizes a UI design that I like is Trello. Trello is a visual collaboration platform to help teams manage and coordinate their 
projects. I can already see some of the UI features being translatable to my own ToDo App and its concept does derive from managing to-dos on a more 
professional level.
