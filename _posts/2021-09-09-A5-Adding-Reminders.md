## Project Summary

In this milestone I added the ability to add reminder dates and for the app to push a notification to the user at the specified reminder ime.

## Project Status

I added a Work Manager and made adjustments to the view model to push the title and details of an added notification to the phone screen if the user has chosen a reminder date. I had issues
with getting the notification to push at the right time so I will have to fix that issue. I also had trouble getting the next todo ids so I had to implement a "hack" suggested by a student in class
to get the right todo's data for the notification.

## Lessons Learned

I learned to use the WorkManager to schedule operations and task within an app and how to create a notification.
