# Step 2: Exploring the Problem


## Problem: Managing Subscriptions (Idea \#17)

### Persona and Scenario:

Any one today who is subscribed to a number of video streaming website, gym memberships, apps with premium features, and any other subscription based service.

### Trigger:

The user notices multiple recurring charges on their credit/debit card account.

### Desired Outcome:

The user logs in to the account to cancel the subscription if they decide they dont need it and they stop seeing the recurring charge on their bank/credit card statement.

### Base Knowledge:

I expect the user knows all the services they are subscribed to. I expect the user knows how to sign up and cancel these services manually. 

### Required Knowledge:

The user needs to know their login information for the service if it's online based or all necessary information otherwise. They need to know about their bank/credit card information so they start or stop that recurring charge and confirm that it's cancelled.
